This file contains very brief instructions on how to install and activate
this plugin on SlimServer. For full details please refer to:
http://hickinbottom.demon.co.uk/slimserver/lazy-searching/lazy-searching2.htm

1. Make sure you are running SlimServer 6.5 or later (you need a different
version of the plugin for SlimServer 6.3.x or 6.2.x - see the website if that
applies to you).

2. Copy LazySearch2.pm to your SlimServer plugins directory.
Windows: C:\Program Files\SlimServer\Server\Plugins
Linux: it depends, but something like /usr/local/slimserver/Plugins

3. Restart SlimServer to make sure it has seen the new plugin.

4. Make sure the plugin is present and ticked on the 'Server Settings/Plugins'
page on the SlimServer web interface.

5. Start using the plugin when the initial background scan has finished.
The plugin will begin adding lazy search indexing the first time the server
is restarted, and this will take a while. The server and player should remain
responsive during this period, but you'll get a brief warning on the player
if you try to search before the process has finished. This won't interrupt
the indexing, however, so you can safely keep trying to see if the scan has
finished.

Press SEARCH on the SqueezeBox/Transporter remote to access the Lazy Search
Music menu; press SEARCH again to access the original Search Music menu.

If you need further information then please refer to the homepage of this
plugin:
