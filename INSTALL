This file contains very brief instructions on how to install and activate
this plugin on SlimServer. For full details please refer to:
http://www.hickinbottom.com/lazysearch

1. Make sure you are running SlimServer 7.0 or later (you need different
versions of the plugin for earlier versions of SlimServer - see the website if
that applies to you).

2. Extract the ZIP file (being sure to preserve the paths in the ZIP file), and
copy the resulting LazySearch2 directory to your SlimServer plugins directory.
Windows: C:\Program Files\SlimServer\Server\Plugins
Linux: it depends, but something like /usr/local/slimserver/Plugins
MacOSX: ~/Library/SlimDevices/Plugins (I believe you need to do this
  as the user that you originally installed SlimServer as.

3. Restart SlimServer to make sure it has seen the new plugin.
Windows: use the 'services' applet in the control panel, or the SlimServer
  tray icon in the bottom-right of the screen if you have it running.
Linux: it depends, but something like '/etc/init.d/slimserver restart'.
Mac OS X: use the standard OSX 'System Properties' menu.

4. Make sure the plugin is present and enabled on the 'Server Settings/Plugins'
page on the SlimServer web interface.

5. Start using the plugin when the initial background scan has finished.
The plugin will begin adding lazy search indexing the first time the server
is restarted, and this will take a while. The server and player should remain
responsive during this period, but you'll get a brief warning on the player
if you try to search before the process has finished. This won't interrupt
the indexing, however, so you can safely keep trying to see if the scan has
finished.

Press SEARCH on the SqueezeBox/Transporter remote to access the Lazy Search
Music menu; press SEARCH again to access the original Search Music menu.
