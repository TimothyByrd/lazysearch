This file contains very brief instructions on how to install and activate
this plugin on Squeezebox Server. For full details please refer to:
http://www.hickinbottom.com/lazysearch

1. Make sure you are running Squeezebox Server 7.0 or later (you need different
versions of the plugin for earlier versions of the server (or SlimServer, or
SqueezeCenter as it was previously called) - see the website if that applies to
you).

2. Extract the ZIP file (being sure to preserve the paths in the ZIP file), and
copy the resulting LazySearch2 directory to your Squeezebox Server plugins
directory.

Windows: C:\Program Files\Squeezebox Server\Server\Plugins
Linux: it depends, but something like /usr/local/squeezecentre/Plugins
MacOSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Squeezebox Server/Plugins (I believe you
  need to do this as the user that you originally installed Squeezebox Server
  as.

3. Restart Squeezebox Server to make sure it has seen the new plugin.
Windows: use the 'services' applet in the control panel, or the Squeezebox
  Server tray icon in the bottom-right of the screen if you have it running.
Linux: it depends, but something like '/etc/init.d/squeezecentre restart'.
Mac OS X: use the standard OSX 'System Properties' menu.

4. Make sure the plugin is present and enabled on the 'Settings/Plugins'
page on the Squeezebox Server web interface.

5. Start using the plugin when the initial background scan has finished.
The plugin will begin adding lazy search indexing the first time the server
is restarted, and this will take a while. The server and player should remain
responsive during this period, but you'll get a brief warning on the player
if you try to search before the process has finished. This won't interrupt
the indexing, however, so you can safely keep trying to see if the scan has
finished.

Press SEARCH on the SqueezeBox/Transporter remote to access the Lazy Search
Music menu; press SEARCH again to access the original Search Music menu.
