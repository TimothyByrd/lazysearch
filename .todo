        Try to do an initial scan after plugin init - maybe just pretend we've seen a rescan command? I had thought about the plugin having a look in the database when it starts up to see if it needs to do anything, but was worried that there might be a timing issue with doing this "too early" while slimserver is starting. I'll have a try, though, and see what happens. If that works, you wouldn't have to do that initial rescan, but it might take a few more seconds for the server to start up. (ceejay [ceejay.1y4gfb@no-mx.forums.slimdevices.com]). Add a preference to turn off this behaviour, but default it to on.

        BUG - I love this plugin. However I noticed that it doesn't work well with musicmagic plugin activated: - all artists end up as double entries (instead of 1000 artists I have 2000) - when playing a song it shows as title (artist &amp; artist) eg dreadlock holiday (10cc &amp; 10cc) - I am unaware of others, but for me the lazy search song never shows any results (maxman) [the 'no results' part of this has been fixed, and the other part is the playlist/duplicates bug]

        Investigate duplicate artists being created during a rescan that adds new files. Seems to be that the NAMESEARCH column is being used as a comparison, but of course that's never going to match because I've bodged the lazy version in there. It might affect other core classes too.

        Playing "greatest hits" or similar where there are multiple albums with the same name will cause all similar albums to be acted on also. This doesn't affect standard search, but does seem to also affect standard "browse", so is probably a core slimserver bug. Millhouse reported this. Millhouse has seen this with 6.2.1 (r5194)

        COSMETIC - When you select an artist or album in the regular search method, it will put the artist or album name, followed by "(1 of ...)" in small print over the name of the choice.  The next screen is artist/album for artist search.  Yours puts "Browse ..." on the page after selecting a search result, and just album for the next page on the artist search. Mostly cosmetic, of course, but it would be great if the display wording matched the regular search. (thanks skyrush). ** I can't work this one out - seems to be something decided by browsedb, but can't see how to convince it to show the right thing up there (SEARCH button manages it somehow, but it's difficult to follow)

So you can search or browse to the new stuff - without having done a rescan.  But it seems that the "lazification" doesn't get kicked off, so LazySearch  won't find it. (ceejay)
