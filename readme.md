Lazy Search Music Plugin for Squeezebox Server, SqueezeCenter and SlimServer
"Never put off until tomorrow what you can put off until the day after"

Performing searches using the Squeezebox/Transporter infra-red remote controls
is somewhat cumbersome, to say the least. Multiple button-pushes are required
to enter each search character - something that not only takes a long time, but
which is quite often error prone as well.

This plugin for SqueezeBox Server from Logitech attempts to remove both of
these annoyances - allowing you to search both more quickly and more
accurately. As a quick comparison, searching for "SQUEEZE" with the standard
search takes around 20 button-pushes, but with this plugin it takes only seven.
That's 65% fewer buttons-pushes!

As the plugin removes the need for multiple button-pushes I call this Lazy
Searching.
